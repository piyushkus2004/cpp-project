## This code defines a basic blockchain structure in C++, including a Block structure and a Blockchain class. Each block contains an index, timestamp, data, previous hash, and hash. The blockchain class manages the blocks, adding new blocks and ensuring the integrity of the chain through hashing and validation methods. This is a simplified implementation for educational purposes and may lack features such as consensus mechanisms and peer-to-peer networking found in real-world blockchain systems
